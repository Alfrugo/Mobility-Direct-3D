            <li><span class="span-class">Online Application -</span> Developing
            an online application system can make the eligibility process more
            convenient for applicants. This would allow individuals to apply for
            paratransit services from the comfort of their homes using a
            computer or mobile device. The online application system can also
            provide guidance to applicants, ensure that all required information
            is included, and reduce the chances of errors or omissions.</li>
          
          <li> <span class="span-class">Determination -</span> Automating the
          determination process using software can speed up the eligibility
          determination process and make it more accurate. The software can use
          algorithms to evaluate the eligibility criteria and make
          determinations based on the responses provided by the applicants.</li>
       
          <li>  <span class="span-class">Data Analytics -</span>  Collecting and
          analyzing data on the eligibility process can provide valuable
          insights into the process's effectiveness and identify areas for
          improvement. This can include data on application processing times,
          eligibility determination rates, and applicant satisfaction
          levels.</li>
       
          <li> <span class="span-class">Communication Management -</span>
          Communication Management can be used to streamline communication
          between the transit agency and applicants. This can include sending
          notifications and reminders to applicants about the status of their
          application and scheduling rides. Automated notifications can help
          reduce missed appointments and improve overall service quality.
          </li>
          <li><span class="span-class">Accessibility Features -</span> Ensuring that the software used in the eligibility
            process is accessible to individuals with disabilities can improve the overall
            user experience. This can include features such as screen reader compatibility,
            font size adjustment, and keyboard navigation.
          </li>

          <li> <span class="span-class">Cost Savings -</span>
            Mobility Direct can help improve efficiencies, accuracy, and accessibility
        of the eligibility process for paratransit agencies. Transit agencies can ensure that individuals with disabilities have
        access to the transportation services they need while reducing administrative
        burdens and costs.
